# Privacy Policy for Scratch Extension

**Last Updated: January 2025**

## Overview
Scratch is a Chrome extension that allows users to draw and annotate directly on web pages. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

## Data Collection
**We do not collect any personal data.** Scratch does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, browsing history, or user data to any external servers.

## Local Storage
The extension uses Chrome's local storage API to save:
- Your preferred color palettes
- Custom keyboard shortcuts
- Tool settings (pen size, eraser mode, etc.)
- UI preferences

This data is stored locally on your device only and is never transmitted anywhere.

## Drawings and Annotations
- All drawings and annotations are temporary and exist only in your browser's memory
- Drawings are not saved permanently unless you take a screenshot
- No drawing data is ever sent to external servers
- Drawings disappear when you refresh or leave the page

## Permissions
The extension requires certain permissions to function:
- **activeTab**: To inject drawing functionality into the current webpage
- **storage**: To save your preferences locally
- **host_permissions**: To enable drawing on all websites

These permissions are used solely for the core functionality of drawing on web pages.

## Third-Party Services
Scratch does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

## Data Security
Since we don't collect any data, there is no risk of your personal information being compromised through our service.

## Children's Privacy
Scratch does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above.
